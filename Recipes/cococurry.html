    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p><strong>Tonight</strong> I made this amazing chickpea, lentil and coconut curry that I saw on TikTok. 
         Having seen this, I just had to make it. 
         It was a great tasting curry that I will be 
         making again and again!</p>

        <li>red chilli</li>
        <li>red onion</li>

    </ul>

    <h3> Steps</h3>

        <li>Firstly, chop up red chilli and red
            onion.  Once chopped up, fry this off in an
